# CNN_Project_FlowerSpeciesRecognition
###Flowers species Recognition using CNN applying ImageAugmentation, Callbacks-[Learning rate annealer, early_stopping, Model_checkpoint]
###Applyied Regularisation techniques: 1.DropoutRegularisation 2.Weight_Regularisers
###Made own custom models as well as applied Transfer learning to extract pretrained model weights of  ResNet50, InceptionV3 ,VGG16 models to compare which works well on this dataset
